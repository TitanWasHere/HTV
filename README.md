# HTV
HTV Project for the cassini hackaton

## Description
This project is an application that allows farmers to monitor their crops and get information about the weather and the soil.

For the moment the application uses Google Earth Engine to get the satellite images and the weather information, we didn't develop the real UI for the application, we just created a simple UI to show how the application works.
